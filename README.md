2048_CLONE
created by clazchow on 25/02/15

This is a clone game of a famous number-based puzzle game 2048 created with Unity3D.

It is created for pratical use but I thought it could be some help to anyone who are looking for it.

Instructions
-------------
1. Swipe the screen to determine where the tiles go.
2. The goal is to get the 2048 tile but you can still keep go on until all the grids are full.
3. If no tiles are able to move in that direction, swiping in that direction won't count.
